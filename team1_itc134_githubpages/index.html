    <p>What is Volunteer Computing?
Volunteer computing is an arrangement in which volunteers provide computing resources to projects, which use the resources (processing power, storage, and Internet connection) of volunteers to do distributed computing and/or storage. Volunteers are typically anonymous members of the general public, organizations can also act as volunteers and contribute their computing resources; projects are typically academic (university-based) and do scientific research.
How does Volunteer Computing work?
Abstract Introduction to Volunteer Computing:  To begin to understand volunteer computing one must first understand; computing.  That volunteer computing uses more than one computer.  By the use of other computer resources to connect more computers and their resources to form a supercomputer.  What are the different types of computing?  What are the resources? What is Object-oriented programming?  and What is Distributed Memory?  Volunteer computing includes Grid, Utility, Distributed and Cluster computing.  With Object-oriented programs, objects and resources can be related.  To then follow the use of distributed memory and hard disk resources along with general resources of the CPU.
