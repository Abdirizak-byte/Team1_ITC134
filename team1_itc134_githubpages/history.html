    <p>Volunteer computing was officially born in January 1996 with a project called GIMPS (Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search). GIMPS was created by George Woltman. George Woltman finished the Project on December 20th 2012 after successfully double checking every smaller Mersenne Number than M(25964951) which proved that this prime is the 42nd Mersenne prime. In 1997 distributed.net was founded which was the first internetâ€™s first general purpose distributed computing project. Distributed.net used VC to win several cryptographic challenges of notoriously difficult encryption algorithms.</p>
    
    <p>In May 1999 a very well known VC project started called SETI@home. SETI@home had over 3.32 million users participating. This project was used to process radio telescopic data in order to find extraterrestrial intelligence. This VC project had the ability to compute over 925 teraflops.</p>
    
    <p>Grid.org was established in 2001 and operated several VC projects which allowed workers to donate their available computing resources to projects. The first project of grid.org successfully screened billions of target molecules  against known cancer target proteins. Grid.org also had projects that helped identify treatments for smallpox and anthrax. Right now, grid.org is analyzing human proteins folding, hidden Markov Modeling and Webload testing. These are just a few of some of the hundreds of thousands of amazing VC projects that have been completed or are still running to this day.</p>
