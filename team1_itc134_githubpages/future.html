    <p>What would a “result” from a volunteer computing project look like? The direct result would be in the form of new knowledge or new information, which, ideally, would be published in a peer-reviewed journal or maintained in an open, publicly accessible database. The furthering of human knowledge is a noble goal in and of itself, but that is not necessarily where the results of volunteer computing projects stop. Ideally, these results will be taken up by scientists, in both the public and private sectors, and used to create things needed by humanity.</p>
    <p>The first volunteering computing project, GIMPS, has found 16 new large prime numbers since it was started in 1996. These primes are reported on the GIMPS website, giving credit to the volunteer computer who found each one. Folding@home has resulted in 216 publications, with active research continuing. Perhaps one of the most exciting findings due to volunteer computing is the discovery of a new pulsar by Einstein@home. The creator of SETI@home responded to the finding: "There are a lot of volunteer computing projects, and many have made scientific progress, but it has been largely incremental. … This is the first discovery of something new" (Sanders). Additionally, volunteer computing projects have been the recipients of various awards and recognitions. SETI@home is in the 2006 Guinness Book of World Records for Largest Computation. Unfortunately, SETI@home has not made definitive contact with extraterrestrial intelligent life yet, although there have been “anomalies” detected that could be investigated further. The creator of Rosetta@home, a volunteer computing project investigating protein structure, won the 2004 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology.</p>
    <p>Volunteer computing may have started out in the research world, but many philanthropic organizations have realized its potential and have started their own projects. Malaria Control, a part of the Africa@home project, receives funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in order to vaccine effectiveness and the epidemiology of the disease. The World Community Grid, a philanthropic venture of IBM, and while their main purpose is to find solutions to a number of real-world problems, they are advancing scientific knowledge. Thanks to investigations into the production of a more efficient, cheaper water filter, the Computing for Clean Water project has published an article in Nature Nanotechnology on photon-induced oscillating friction. (Ma). In all, the World Community Grid reports that 35 peer-reviewed papers have been published from their research. While they have not reported on any tangible results from their work yet, the potential for future application is certainly there. The Quake-Catcher Networks uses information collected from an array of USB sensors on volunteer computers’ devices to create a database of seismological activity; this data has the potential to be turned into an earthquake early-warning system.</p>
